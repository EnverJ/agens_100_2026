Your limitations.md must mention:

1. Token limit
   •	Memory grows → prompt grows
   •	Eventually context is truncated
2. Memory pollution
   •	Wrong answers get stored
   •	Errors compound over time
3. No reasoning improvement
   •	Memory ≠ smarter model
   •	Only more context
4. No long-term persistence
   •	Restart = memory wiped
5. No understanding
   •	Model does not “know” what is important
