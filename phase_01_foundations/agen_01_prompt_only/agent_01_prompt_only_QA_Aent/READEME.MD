# Agent 01 – Prompt-only QA Agent

## Goal
Build the simplest possible LLM-based agent with no memory or tools.

## Architecture
- Stateless
- Single prompt → single response

## What I Learned
- Prompt phrasing impacts answer quality
- LLM hallucination is common without constraints

## Next Improvement
Add tool usage or memory
