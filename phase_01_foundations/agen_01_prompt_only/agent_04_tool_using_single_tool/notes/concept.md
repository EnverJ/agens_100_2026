## Core Concept – Agent 01

Agent 01 is a text-based, prompt-only AI agent.

It takes user text as input and converts the text into tokens.
These tokens are processed by a local language model through multiple internal layers.
The model generates an answer by predicting the most likely next tokens based on learned patterns.

The agent does not understand meaning or truth.
It only generates text based on probability.

This agent is stateless.
Each question is handled independently, and no memory of previous interactions is stored.

The purpose of Agent 01 is to demonstrate the most basic AI agent loop:
user input → model processing → text output.

Agent 01 can give confident but wrong answers because it does not verify truth.

The language model generates responses by predicting the most likely next tokens based on patterns learned during training.
It is not reasoning about facts and does not check answers against reality.

Because each input is processed independently and the model has no awareness of correctness, it can produce fluent but incorrect answers with high confidence.
